1. Create a folder called "readturtle".


2. Insert the directory the files readturlte.cpp, turtlescript.cpp, turtlescript.hpp and readturlteRakefile from test.mk16.de/scriptFiles or bitbucket.org/marek22k/scriptFiles/.

3. Create a file named "config.yml" and add:
---
boost: [YOUR BOOST DIRECTORY]

Replace [YOUR BOOST DIRECTORY] with your C++ Boost Library path.

4. Execute the following command at a terminal: rake -f readturtleRakefile

5. To check if readturtle works, run the following command: rake -f readturtleRakefile test
It would now have, among other things, "100% of the tests were successful." be issued.

6. To delete the temporary build files that were created while building readturtle,
run the following command: rake -f readturtleRakefile clean

There will now be a new file in the directory: "readturtle.exe" or "readturtle.out" or similar.
(This differs depending on the operating system)

If building does not work, check if you have Ruby, the Rubygem Rake, and a C++ compiler installed.
